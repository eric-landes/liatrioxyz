# Welcome to the XYZ Executive Summary
Welcome to the Executive Summary for the XYZ Dojo.  XYZ corp. reached out to Liatrio for assistance in getting high quality software into their customers hands more quickly than they currently do.  This ask included working with the IT teams to move workloads into the cloud and modernize the current architecture.

Liatro has many years of expertise moving workloads from on prem to Azure, for instance at [CareSource](https://insights.liatrio.com/CaseStudies/CareSource_2021.pdf).  Our teams ability to modernize applications is a standard in the industry.  Based on our expertise, we have the following recommendation.

Liatrio recommends our DOJO approach.  We have found that using immersive learning techniques like our DOJO is the best way for adults to learn new concepts.  Our coaches sit side by side your teams and help them learn by doing.  Instead of learning on a fictional application, they learn on what they already know.  Our coaches guide team members through this learning experience.

The Dojo itself is a six week experience for the your team.  There is prep before hand with initial consulting and finalizing the charter taking an additional 2-3 weeks.  Liatrio will supply 2 coaches with expertise in DevOps and Infrastructure As Code (IAC), for the length of the engagement.  XYZ dev team 1 will be a full time participant with operations groups expected to particpate extensivily as well.

Measure success by the reduction of lead times to production, and higher quality released to customers.  This will be monitered frequently throughout the engagement.  If successful XYZ has the option to continue with the coaches and another team.  The goal is to establish the immersive learning model via the Dojo even when Liatrio coaches are not with the teams.  We are excited to partner with XYZ.
