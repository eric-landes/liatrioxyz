# XYZ Executive Summary  ![logo](image/liatriologo.svg)
Liatrio is thrilled to collaborate with XYZ Corp., responding to their need for accelerated software delivery to customers. XYZ Corp. sought our expertise to enhance their IT processes, specifically in migrating workloads to the cloud and modernizing existing architecture.

With a proven track record, Liatrio has successfully facilitated similar transformations, exemplified by our work at [CareSource](https://insights.liatrio.com/CaseStudies/CareSource_2021.pdf). We specialize in not only migrating workloads but also in modernizing applications, setting a high standard within the industry.

## Recommendation: Liatrios Dojo Approach

Liatrio proposes implementing our Dojo approach. Drawing from our experience, we have observed that immersive learning, such as our Dojo, is the most effective method for adults to grasp new concepts. Our approach involves our expert coaches working closely with your teams, guiding them through hands-on learning experiences on familiar applications rather than theoretical scenarios.

## The DOJO Experience:

- A comprehensive six week program for your team.  
- Prepratory activities include initial consulting and charter finalization taking an additional 2-3 weeks.  
- 2 dedicated coaches with expertise in DevOps and Infrastructure As Code (IAC), for the length of the engagement.  
- Full time involvement from the XYZ dev team 1 with extensive involvement expected from operations groups.

## Key Success Metrics
Success will be gauged monitoring the reduction of lead times to production, and higher quality released to customers.  We meet with leadership to discuss these metrics throughout the engagement.  

Upon succesful completion, XYZ has the option to continue with the coaches and another team.  The goal is to establish the immersive learning model via the Dojo even when Liatrio coaches are not with the teams.  We are excited to partner with XYZ.
